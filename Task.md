*  Using Google Search for documentation
*  Referring to StackOverflow for troubleshooting
*  Reading official documentation
---
# 🔧 **Requirements**

## **1️⃣ Authentication (Simple Local Login)**

* Create a login page with:

  * **Static credentials** (example):

    * Email: `test@example.com`
    * Password: `123456`
